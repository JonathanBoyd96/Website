        <h2>Welcome To My Website!</h2>
        <p>This website was entirely built my me, including establishing the backend database, hosting services and connecting them to work properly.
            You can view to my experience or contact info from the navigation panel on the left as well as some of my personal projects below the white bar.
            This website is hosted in github pages and uses multiple backend services that sync well with github. I am using Supabase to host a SQL database
            that is used in my API and Database project. I am using render to host the flask service that I need in python for the NLP AI processing. I am also
            working on documenting my projects in Jira just to show doucmentation of the process.
